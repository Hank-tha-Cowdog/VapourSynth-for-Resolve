# Build instructions

In order to build the plugin you need to point the project at the OpenFX headers and source code. These are included with Resolve when installed and are usually located in C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Developer\OpenFX or a similar location.

They can also be located by clicking Help\Documentation\Developer in Resolve.
