# VapourSynth-for-Resolve
VapourSynth OFX plugin for Davinci Resolve Fusion which brings open source Python-based image processing into a Resolve pipeline. (currently Windows OS only)

This OFX plugin is the result of my own frustration at the limited toolset provided within Davinci Resolve Fusion to address a plethora of novel motion picture artifacts for color grading and restoration. If you require more nuanced and deeply customizable tools for your work, this tool will hopefully provide a solution.  

In its current form, the tool can support the following: 
* Deinterlacing using QTGMC 
* Chroma subsampling and upsampling
* Color space conversion

Hopefully with the contributions from the VapourSynth community, we can continue to develop this tool until colorists and restoration artists can't live without it.
